thin_draws(x, thin = NULL, ...)

\method{thin_draws}{draws}(x, thin = NULL, ...)

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{(draws) A \code{draws} object or another \R object for which the method
is defined.}

\item{thin}{(positive integer) The period for selecting draws. If
omitted, this will be automatically calculated based on bulk-ESS
and tail-ESS as suggested by Säilynoja et al. (2022).}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to individual methods (if applicable).}
}
\value{
A \code{draws} object of the same class as \code{x}.
}
\description{
